This repo contains the code of a Fake News Detector app for the French language. It has been built during the Hackathon of Connective Cities in November 2021, as an answer to the needs expressed by two municipalities in Africa: Lomé, Togo, and Antananarivo, Madagascar, two French-speaking countries. 


PITCH:
Capitaine Info is a web robot to prevent fake news, misinformation and radical propagandists on social media platforms. 

Each time a user tries to publish a message with an exaggerating alarming tone, aggressive content, or a dissonant message compared to the overall sentiment expressed on the platform, Capitaine Info suspends the publication and asks the user a confirmation, reminding that certain messages can affect the most sensitive users and should be fact checked before being published.

Most social media users are victims of fake news instead of real propagandists. Indeed, we live in an era of instant global communication, where it is impossible to know all the truth on every topic. But Capitaine Info knows! Because he is watching all what’s published by each user on the platform, he can help users to not be fooled when they are publishing online content.

Capitaine Info is a combination of different artificial intelligence algorithms such as natural language processing and sentiment analysis, filtering each message before it is published on a private group calling him as a supporting web manager. Capitaine Info will suspend the publication of a message until the user confirms it really wants to publish its message and assumes the responsibility of the information source.
